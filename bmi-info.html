            <h2>What is BMI?</h2>
            <p>
                BMI stands for <strong>Body Mass Index</strong>. It is a simple number calculated using your height and weight to help understand whether your weight falls within a certain range.
            </p>
            <p>BMI is commonly used as a general screening tool — not as a diagnosis.</p>

            <h2>How is BMI calculated?</h2>
            <p>BMI is calculated by dividing your weight (in kilograms) by the square of your height (in meters).</p>
            <p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
            <p>BMI = weight (kg) ÷ height² (m²)</p>

            <h2>BMI Ranges</h2>
            <p>Here’s how BMI values are commonly grouped:</p>            
            <ul class="bmi-ranges">
                <li class="underweight"><span class="icon">🌱</span>
                    <strong>Below 18.5:</strong> Lower range
                </li>
                <li class="normal"><span class="icon">💚</span>
                    <strong>18.5 – 24.9:</strong> Healthy range
                </li>
                <li class="overweight"><span class="icon">🌼</span>
                    <strong>25 – 29.9:</strong> Higher range
                </li>
                <li class="obese"><span class="icon">🌸</span>
                    <strong>30 and above:</strong> Very high range
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p> These ranges are general guidelines and may not reflect individual health conditions. </p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>What BMI does NOT tell you</h2>
            <p>BMI does not measure body fat directly, and it does not consider:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Muscle mass</li>
                <li>Bone density</li>
                <li>Age or gender</li>
                <li>Overall lifestyle or fitness level</li>
            </ul>
            <p> This means two people with the same BMI can have very different bodies and health profiles. </p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>A gentle reminder</h2>
            <p> Health is more than a number. BMI can be a helpful starting point, but it should never define your worth or well-being. </p>
            <p> If you have concerns about your health, consider speaking with a qualified healthcare professional. </p>
